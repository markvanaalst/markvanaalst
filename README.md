Hi ðŸ‘‹,

As a developer with roots in the early 2000s Microsoft tech landscape, Iâ€™ve evolved alongside the web, trying to keep up with languages and frameworks to stay at the forefront of development. Recently, my expertise has centered on full stack development with technologies like React, TypeScript, and Next.js, focusing on creating high-performance, user-centric applications. With a passion for modern front-end stacks and a rich history in the field, I blend experience with innovation to push boundaries.
